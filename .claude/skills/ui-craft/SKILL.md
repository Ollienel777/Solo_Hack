name: ui-craft
description: Standards and process for building advanced, mature product UI that wins hackathon judging, covering the design direction (hackathon/DESIGN.md), building screens, the visual review rubric, and screenshot-based verification. Use whenever writing or changing anything a user sees, writing a design direction, reviewing a PR that touches UI, rehearsing a demo, or when the user asks to make the UI better, more polished, or less generic.

# UI craft

Judges form an opinion of a project in its first ten seconds on screen, before
they understand what it does. A mature UI signals a finished product. It also
makes the demo easy to follow, since the eye lands where the story is. Two
working projects are usually separated by exactly this.

**"Mature" means restraint and completeness, not decoration.** The bar is a
funded product (Linear, Vercel, Stripe, Raycast), not a template. **"Advanced"
means the interface makes the product's core mechanic tangible**: output that
streams in with structure, a change you can watch happen, direct manipulation.
It does not mean effects added on top.

## Who reads this for what

| you are | read |
|---|---|
| the planner, writing `hackathon/DESIGN.md` | [`references/design-direction.md`](references/design-direction.md), then the standards below |
| an implementer building a screen | the standards below, and `hackathon/DESIGN.md` |
| a reviewer or rehearser | [`references/rubric.md`](references/rubric.md) |
| a human asked for polish directly | [working standalone](#working-standalone) |

## Standards

- **One direction, written down, expressed as tokens.** Components use the
  tokens in `DESIGN.md`, never raw hex values or one-off pixel sizes. Most
  inconsistency starts as a single hard-coded value.
- **Each screen has one job and one primary action.** Decide what a judge
  should look at during that demo beat, and make it the heaviest thing on the
  screen. Everything else steps back.
- **Colour carries meaning.** Use neutral surfaces and a single accent,
  reserved for the primary action and the key state. Semantic colours
  (success, warning, danger) are used only for their meaning.
- **Typography does most of the hierarchy.** One family, plus a monospace for
  data or code. A small scale. Weight and colour do more of the work than
  size. Numbers in data use tabular figures.
- **Spacing is systematic.** Use a 4px base and consistent padding inside each
  component type. Align everything to shared edges. Make density suit the
  task: data tools can be dense, while a hero moment gets room.
- **Every state is designed.**
  - Empty states explain and offer the next action.
  - Loading uses a skeleton that matches the final layout, and AI output
    streams in progressively.
  - Errors say what happened and how to recover.
  - Success is confirmed.
  - Long text, and zero, one or many items, all still look right.
  - A spinner alone for more than a second reads as a hang.
- **The data looks real.** Fixtures tell the demo's story, with plausible
  names, numbers, dates and content. Never "Test User", lorem ipsum, or a
  dashboard full of zeros.
- **Every action gets feedback within 100ms.** Prefer optimistic updates. Use
  motion to explain change (enter, exit, reorder, expand), at 150–250ms with
  ease-out and without bounce, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **The hero moment is designed like a keynote slide.** It is big, focused,
  readable from the back of the room, and it animates deliberately.
- **Add advanced interactions only where they serve the core mechanic.**
  Options include a command palette, keyboard shortcuts, streamed structured
  output, inline editing, undo toasts, drag and drop, and live presence. Pick
  the few that make this product's idea felt.
- **Copy is part of the design.** Use specific verbs, sentence case and short
  labels. No exclamation marks, and no "Welcome to X!" on an empty dashboard.
- **Basic accessibility signals maturity.**
  - text contrast of at least AA
  - visible focus
  - semantic elements
  - labelled controls
  - hit targets of at least 40px
- **The demo path has to feel fast.** No layout shift, preloaded fonts, sized
  images, and no blocking work on first paint.

**Default stack, when the spec is React:** Tailwind with CSS-variable tokens,
shadcn/ui (Radix) components, `lucide-react` icons, and `motion` for
transitions. If a data-visualisation skill is available, use it for charts.
The standards hold on any stack.

## What makes a UI look generic

Judges have seen these hundreds of times, so each one marks a project as a
template:

- purple-to-blue gradients on everything
- glassmorphism
- a glow behind every card
- emoji standing in for icons
- a centred hero above three feature cards
- default-blue buttons
- every card given a border, a shadow *and* a gradient
- mixed corner radii
- grey text on a grey background
- five or more font weights
- a spinner as the only loading state
- a modal for every interaction
- an enormous empty page around tiny content

## Look at it

**Never call a UI finished without looking at a screenshot taken in this
session.** Code that reads correctly still renders wrong.

- Use the repository's screenshot script if M0 created one. Otherwise write a
  throwaway Playwright script in a scratch directory.
- Capture every screen you changed at **1440×900** (the demo), **1280×720** (the
  video) and **390×844** (mobile), in each theme the product ships.
- Look at each screenshot against `DESIGN.md` and the rubric. Fix what you
  find, then capture again. Two passes are normal. Stopping after the first
  capture is how obvious defects get shipped.
- Exercise the states as well as the happy path. Seed an empty account, force
  an error, and slow the network.

## Working standalone

When a human asks directly for polish:

1. Run the app, and capture the demo-path screens.
2. Audit them against [`references/rubric.md`](references/rubric.md).
3. Present the findings, most visible first.

**If the build loop is running**, file the findings as `ui` tickets per
`docs/build/PLAN.md`, rather than editing files the loop's agents may be
working in. Otherwise, fix the top findings, capture again, and show the
before and after.
